<p> My name is Balsam Abbadi, a third-year computer science student at Khadouri University.<br> 
    I am twenty years old and I live in Jenin. <br>
    One of my friends introduced me to this course and I admit that I enjoy it and learn a lot from it.<br> 
    I don't know what more I should write but I think this might be enough hhhhhh  </p>

    <h2><br>Jenin city</h2>
    <P>Jenin, town in the West Bank. Originally administered as part of the British mandate of Palestine <br>
        (1920–48), Jenin was in the area annexed by Jordan in 1950 following the first of the Arab-Israeli<br>
         wars (1948–49). After the Six-Day War of 1967, it was part of the West Bank territory under Israeli <br>
         occupation until coming under the administration of the Palestinian Authority in the wake of the <br>
         1993 Oslo Accords.</P>
